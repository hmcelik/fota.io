                        The Greenland: The Land of Eternity, where was once the birthplace of the Aether. The Greenland
                        is home to god-like creatures known as the Omni and Dragon. <br>
                        The Earth: The Ultimate Civilization. Here the Elf, Human and Keen live together and receive the
                        Omni's preparation for the dark days ahead. <br>
                        The Nightmare: The Darkest Night, a wasteland of FOTA universe. Cold, dark and cruel, exactly

                    the evil Ogre army led by the Demon.

                    to the Elf and the Human. Will the universe strike a balance between these forces? Or will it get
                    swallowed up by the bad?

                                Ciara is Cyril's sister and one of the most beautiful goddesses on the Greenland. In the
                                midst of the gods' civil war, she couldn't sit on the sidelines either.
                                Following Cyril to The Nightmare, Ciara was enchanted by the power of the Darkness and
                                transformed into a cold-blooded assassin. She and her brother Cyril together
                                created the Inferno. Now that she embodies the lust and is a haunted obsession of any
                                living thing when nights fall.
                            </p>
                            <span class="label">Story:</span>
                            <p>
                                As The Human gradually corrupted due to the dark magic that Silver had spread, the power
                                Humans possessed became so powerful that they all gave up their faith in the
                                gods. Some heretical mages even had the strength to open their own Space Bridge to
                                communicate with The Omni. However, unlike other mages and Elves, instead of learning
                                from The Omni, those heretics took unfair advantage of that power by summoning then
                                stripping them of their powers. This infuriated many other Omni gods, especially
                                Cyril.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It culminated when Ciara was summoned by those heretics to usurp her power but they were
                                all so struck by her beauty that they locked her up for amusement. By the time
                                that came to Cyril’s ears, it was too late, Ciara had lost most of her power. Cyril
                                frantically slaughtered all the mages and reported this incident to the King of the
                                Gods with the wish for a purge to wipe The Human off The Earth. All these reasons fell
                                on deaf ears when the King thought heretics were all slaves to their impulses and
                                already paid for their crimes, all they had to do is to lead The Human on the right
                                path, not to punish them just for the sins of anyone else.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That incident enraged Cyril and Ciara even more. A predictable war ensued but victory
                                did not belong to them and the King expelled all the rebels out of The Greenland. As a
                                result, that decision fanned the flame of hatred in Ciara. Resonating with magic of The
                                Darkness, the two Cyril and Ciara ignited the Inferno. They vowed to make the
                                world bow at their feet and experience the losses they'd suffered, the pain they'd
                                endured.

                                Keisha was once the most prominent assassin in the Mist Island. But all he wanted was to
                                give up that title and bury his painful past that he had been through, owing to
                                this decision, he was hunted by other assassins. Hiding behind a mask, Keisha becomes
                                the one who establishes order and brings peace to the people of Crown Londo Kingdom.
                            </p>
                            <span class="label">Story:</span>
                            <p>
                                Keisha was born in the Mist Island and said to be a rare talent of the Assassins’
                                League. Strict rules and quick actions had made a young Keisha quite silent and
                                cold-blooded. Focused and meticulous in his duty, Keisha had always been at the front;
                                his ranks ever growing as he reaped. No matter how difficult it was or even if
                                there were innocent victims, Keisha was not allowed to hesitate because of being an
                                assassin of the League, for that title, one had to show no emotion or let it cloud
                                his judgment, and then affect the mission.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, once in the line of duty, he was seriously injured and saved by a girl named
                                Maris, from a tiny fishing village nearby. After weeks of recovery, Keisha
                                gradually developed his feelings for Maris and for this small village. This was
                                considered to be a taboo for an assassin when their rule was inherently "no emotion, no
                                name, no identity, that’s the strongest of all". And Keisha made his own decision, he
                                chose to keep his head down, live a life of sober contemplation in this place. But
                                his past did not let him free, the Assassins League finally found Keisha. They believed
                                that his decision could jeopardize the League’s integrity and forced Keisha to
                                leave that life behind and return to serve the League, or else, they would kill anyone
                                who’s involved. Finally, Keisha agreed to return to ensure the safety of the
                                village.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Assassins League gave him a new quest and wanted him to finish immediately to prove
                                his loyalty. But indeed, that was just an excuse for kicking him out. Others in
                                the League had already agreed to destroy that village, first was to punish and challenge
                                Keisha, and second, to get rid of those who knew his identity. They burned the
                                whole village to the ground as soon as Keisha left.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When Keisha came back, the village was consumed by flames, he dashed to find Maris, but
                                painful as that was for him to witness his beloved forever lying in that raging
                                fire with dozens of corpses. At the sight of death and grief, Keisha frenziedly killed
                                other assassins who caused this tragedy. After the battle, Keisha also had a
                                saber cut in his face and got to spend the rest of eternity in never-ending emotional
                                torment. Since then, he formed another league to confront the Assassins League.
                                Preaching principles of justice, Keisha and his people set up the Balance of Justice
                                amidst the darkness, bringing order to the orderless on The Earth. But what
                                about his fate? Behind that mask is a Keisha trying to escape from his pain and also the
                                assassins of the Mist Island…

                                Aprum was Orson's most skilled warrior. He had super strength and extraordinary
                                endurance, as well as his absolute loyalty to his master - Orson. However, such a
                                peaceful life was not suitable for the restless Aprum. Before the outbreak of war, he
                                was nothing but a lowly soldier in Orson's army. But times had changed, he quickly
                                proved who he was. With the mace in his hand and great enthusiasm in his heart, Aprum
                                rushed into battle and slaughtered anyone who dared to stand in his way.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Aprum was a Beast of the Sentinel. Everyone called him Aprum the Crusher because of his
                                great strength and endurance. However, he was not very skilled in fighting
                                strategy. For him, strength was everything he needed, in battle, just crushed the enemy
                                till death and it’s him for the win.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When war broke out between Orson and Corbetti, Aprum became Orson's mighty warrior. He
                                slaughtered The Creek army so greatly that they all were extremely afraid to
                                stand against him. In a battle at the Space Bridge, it was Aprum who risked his life
                                through The Creek army to get Orson back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Aprum worshiped Orson even though Orson once prevented him from using the dark powers of
                                The Darkness. Orson feared that if a strong warrior like Aprum was overtaken by
                                darkness, he would be so big a threat that no one could have a hold over him. On the
                                other hand, Orson became ever more violent because of that terrifying power… That's
                                why Aprum admired him more and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It appeared that for Aprum, there was no sort of personal vendetta or fighting his tribe
                                or for peace. To him, killing was merely a way to satisfy his hunger and obey
                                Orson’s orders, even handing him in dead. Despite his stupid, fighting against Aprum has
                                never been an easy mission. To the rest of The Nightmare, he is the embodiment
                                of a typical Beast, brutal and feral.

                                Cyril is the brutal tyrant of The Nightmare and the embodiment of all that is evil and
                                arrogant in this universe. Very few people knew he was once a noble Omni. Things
                                started when The Human got lost in constant wars and destroyed others with their
                                powerful weapons and magic. And more terrifying, those who became superior to others
                                thanks to the power of ancient magic no longer worshiped or put their faith in Gods,
                                even worse, they blasphemed them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cyril was one of the first Omni gods to think that it was a wake-up call to destroy
                                Humans to maintain peace on The Earth as well as prevent further dangers. Contrary
                                to his reason, the King thought the world would be out of balance if doing so. With his
                                arrogance, Cyril gathered a group of Omnis with the same ideal, including his
                                sister Ciara, unilaterally attacked The Earth. However, this incident led to the darkest
                                episode in history of the universe.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As The Human fell for the dark power that Silver inspired and became so powerful that
                                slowly they began to renounce their faith in gods. Some even despised and judged
                                that only fools believed in gods. With the rise of dark magic, The Earth fell into long
                                and painful wars for power occurring everywhere. So, the balance of order
                                collapsed. At that time, there was a small group, including Cyril, who believed that
                                sooner or later, all creatures on The Earth would be corrupted and needed to be
                                removed in order to restore peace and prevent further dangers to the universe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In that ideological conflict, Cyril and his fellowman unilaterally prepared to attack
                                The Earth. Then, right on The Greenland, a battle took place between the Omnis,
                                without the support of The Dragons, Cyril and others in his side were quickly defeated
                                and banished from their homeland forever. After this failure, those Omnis became
                                more and more negative and they were devoured by envy and hatred towards The Greenland,
                                they believed that their race, The Omni, were the most powerful beings in the
                                universe that conquered all life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With a heart full of hate, Cyril traveled to the deepest, darkest depths of the universe
                                - The Nightmare. He absorbed dark energy from Darkest and created the Inferno.
                                Here born the brutal lord of hell, Cyril the Devil. He built up a legion of demons and
                                vowed to return and reclaim his throne from the Omni gods. And his ultimate goal
                                was not only revenge, Cyril also wished to get all the Aether energy for himself and
                                become the Lord of lords.

                                Eira is the youngest daughter of three brothers of the Kide in northern of The Earth. Smart and brave is what people say about Eira, as she has within her a
                                courageous spirit inherited from her family, just like other members in the Kide, she
                                also was trained in all manner of combat skills from a very young age. One day,
                                when Silver Serpent - a demon with a crown of light plotted to overthrow the Kide, she
                                fortunately got out of that bloody conquest alive by following a secret
                                passageway leading to the other side of the wall and then was adopted by some Northmen.
                                They taught her Ice Powers and archery as well as how to survive in this harsh
                                land. Now, she returns to The Earth to get justice for her family and all that they
                                have lost in that invasion.

                                Eira Kide is the youngest daughter of Brian Kide - Lord of the North Castle - where
                                snowy winds blow all year round. About half a day away from here is the Northern
                                Wall (The Wall), it is always under close guard by Black Knight warriors to prevent The
                                Beast of The Nightmare from invading The Earth through a Space Bridge here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Brian cherishes her with all his heart as she is his only daughter. Instead of learning
                                how to be a lady as usual, Eira loves to swing swords like her brothers, perhaps
                                due to Kide’s brave blood that flows through her veins.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When Eira was 16, through the sacred rituals of the Council of the Wall, but rather the
                                orders from Silver Serpent, the Council chose Brian to become the next Black
                                Knight Commander and William Kide - Brian’s eldest son - would succeed his father as the
                                new Lord of North Castle.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One year later, Eira made an unexpected trip to The Wall to see her father, it was that
                                time when her father was killed by an unknown assassin of the Mist Island and
                                the Council with some other leaders of Black Knight that the Silver Serpent had got on
                                the take, rebelled. Eira was forced to flee to the other side of The Wall, where
                                she was saved by Hilda - Inuit's commander, but Black Knights called them outsiders for
                                the ice powers they owned.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After this event, Eira once returned to the other side of The Wall, but North Castle’s
                                all gone. After Brian’s death, Silver Serpent continued to invade North Castle,
                                expanding his power and influence over The Earth. For Eira, Hilda taught her how to
                                control ice powers, with her intelligence, Eira practiced and integrated that
                                rare power into the weapon that she was using - bow and arrows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With her iron will, Eira vowed that in her next return with the Inuits and Hilda, she
                                would reclaim North Castle and her ice arrows will pierce the hearts of the wicked
                                in order to bring justice to the Kides and avenge her family.

                                Idril originally was one of the five greatest families of the Elf. Therefore, since
                                birth, Alva always lived in the lap of luxury, and was served by countless servants.
                                Alva was also aware of her nobility and that was a reason for her not being
                                well-behaving, haughty and arrogant towards others. Of course, no one would argue with

                                unruly, all that they’re afraid of was a war coming - the Dark Moon war.

                            <span class="label">Story:</span>
                            <p>
                                Alva was a lady of the noble Idril of The Elf. Because the Idril were one of the five
                                greatest families, since birth, Alva always lived in the lap of luxury, and was
                                served by countless servants. Alva was also aware of her nobility and that was a reason
                                for her not being well-behaving, haughty and arrogant towards others. Of course,
                                no one would argue with her unruly, all that they’re afraid of was a war coming - the
                                Dark Moon War.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Living in the bosom of her family, Alva didn’t have to worry much about others. One day,
                                the Black Knight troops led by Leon (the former commander, after this incident,
                                Brian led the charge) fled from the southern wall and asked her family for a favor to
                                defend against The Ogres army from Kekor’s Black Fortress. The Black Knight had
                                been protecting The Wall for ages with their Auraminum swords. The moment when the
                                Council of The Wall sensed that mysterious magic in the Black Fortress, they
                                immediately summoned Leon and his troops to investigate that source. The Ogres ambushed
                                them as soon as they arrived, so sudden and unexpected was it that Leon’s troops
                                rushed to the south in the hope of getting help from The Elf.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although The Elf had never wanted to interfere in those Human wars, they changed their
                                mind after hearing Leon’s story about Ogre - a new threat to The Earth, they knew once Kekor destroyed the Black Knights and took the Northern
                                Wall, it would be the end of this world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Realizing this was the last chance to eliminate this threat since it was not too strong,
                                Alva's father, the Headman Oberon, opened the seal and let those Black Knights
                                in. However, The Ogres were not that simple, what they wanted was not the Black Knights
                                but the Dreaming Valley - the family heirloom that The Idril had protected for
                                thousands of years. The Ogres knew that it was Human nature to be easily seduced by the
                                Valley and therefore, they were able to take this place and create another Space
                                Bridge from the power the Valley granted. After the first step of the plan went well,
                                The Ogres left and bided their time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The arrival of the Black Knight piqued the curiosity in Alva. That was also the first
                                time she had seen Humans in the flesh. Although her father warned her not to get
                                too close to these Humans, Alva still ignored the warnings. She used her magic to screw
                                with those Humans who were being treated in her castle, this really helped Alva
                                happier than all the other boring things. Since then, her jokes happened over and over
                                again. Although very uncomfortable, Leon still told his men that they were guests
                                here and told them Alva was just a little innocent girl not knowing what was going on
                                out there. Obviously, Leon also felt something suspicious, why did The Ogres let
                                them off so easily? But before he realized that was the trap The Ogres had set, a
                                tragedy struck.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In her last joke, Alva transformed herself into a disgusting and ugly scarecrow to scare
                                off others. Her sudden appearance caused all The Humans to panic. With their
                                warrior spirit, one of them quickly pulled out the Auraminum sword and stabbed it
                                straight into the heart of the scarecrow. This sword could only be possessed by Black
                                Knights, very special and mainly used for killing God and Demon for its resistance to
                                magic as well as The Darkness energy. Therefore, the scarecrow began to bleed,
                                magic disappeared, and revealed itself as Alva, her injury was so lethal that normal
                                magic couldn’t cure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Headman Oberon completely broke with reality that no healing magic could save his little
                                girl, so he decided to use the last resort - to use the power of the Dreaming
                                Valley. Without any more hesitation, all of them quickly got down to the Dreaming Valley
                                hoping to save Alva. Oberon himself was aware of the risks he’s taking when
                                letting Humans into this sacred place, so he decided to have them protect outside of the
                                castle for whilst he did the ritual inside the Dreaming Valley, the
                                castle-protecting seal might be temporarily down. However, this was a big mistake as the
                                Black Knights had not fully recovered after the previous pursuit. The Ogres
                                appeared, seizing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and an unholy war ensued between
                                The Ogres and the Black Knights alongside The Elves. Moreover, not only the
                                appearance of The Ogres but also their King - Kekor suddenly came and joined the war.
                                The Ogres gradually took their place, invaded the castle and slaughtered anyone in
                                their sight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the healing ritual, a miracle somehow happened to Alva, she woke up as if she had
                                never been injured before. However, she soon found herself surrounded by large
                                piles of dead people, and her father's head was in Kekor's arms. He mockingly thanked
                                her for giving him the opportunity to dominate this place. Therefore, he would do
                                her a favor as the sacrifice to open the Space Bridge and summon thousands of Demons
                                into this world. What was going on scared and froze Alva, but a roar from Leon
                                brought her back to reality. Just like her, Leon was taken alive, but with warrior
                                spirit, he easily released himself and seized that opportunity to attack Kekor. That,
                                however, was not enough, Leon was stabbed by Kekor with a sword, ending the life of the
                                old Commander.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Leon’s efforts were not in vain, that amount of time was enough for Alva to do a
                                powerful spell. Alva was an Elf and as a member of the Idril, her mission was to
                                keep this place safe from those dangers of the outside world. The Dreaming Valley
                                responded to the young girl’s request, a Bridge opened and a god descended from above.
                                Godwyn - the God of light and hope, appeared and dispelled darkness in the Dreaming
                                Valley. With that powerful spell resonating with the magic of the Dreaming Valley,
                                Alva successfully repelled the invaders, and peace finally returned. But now that Alva
                                realizes that the world is crueler than she has imagined and so dangerous for an
                                orphan girl. But she will not shirk that huge responsibility for any reason, Alva will
                                stay here and guard the Valley with all her life.

                                Zel was once a member of the noble Dragon in The Greenland. But after coming into
                                contact with the Magic Lake, he had turned into a hideous Bell Cobra. Abandoned by his
                                own kind, then wandering to the Nightmare, saved by Orson, reborn by power of the
                                Darkness, he saw himself as the Beast of this new land instead of a noble Dragon. He
                                vowed to one day make the Dragon pay for what they had put him in. Now, he is the key
                                bridge between Orson and the Demon.

                                The Greenland was said to be the brightest world, the birthplace of the immortal
                                dragons. However, there existed a mysterious area called the Magical Lake with deadly
                                charms that no one has dared to venture into. It was also the beginning of a string of
                                tragedies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Zel used to be a member of The Dragon in The Greenland. Zel did not believe that the
                                Magic Lake was a forbidden area for Dragons as they had been taught. He thought
                                that everything in this universe could be purified with the Aether. Then a tragedy
                                struck while Zel was exploring this area. Magic Lake with its poison entering Zel’s
                                body transformed him into the form of a creature known as Bell Cobra, a hideous Bell
                                Cobra.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Zel was forced to live alone in the Magic Lake after being exiled by his own kind.
                                Hatred overtook him. Zel gradually perfected his body by employing resistance to
                                poisons and the oldest magics while silently researching magic and potions here. Zel
                                also discovered a secret Space Bridge and then was teleported to The Nightmare
                                while exploring it. He was so alone and starving when being rescued by Orson in the
                                worst condition. Since Orson enriched Zel with dark power from The Darkness, he
                                gradually got better and slowly his powers returned. As a token of his appreciation, Zel
                                revealed some of the knowledge he had discovered about the Magic Lake to Orson.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Quickly adapting and freely consuming the power of The Darkness, Zel brought himself
                                back as a Beast of The Nightmare rather than a noble Dragon of The Greenland. His
                                end game was to take revenge on The Dragon, give them a taste of their own medicine. He
                                felt good being a Beast. Even those who were on his side didn't know clearly
                                what he wanted; all they knew was that Zel, although cunning, was too clever.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After Orson’s defeat in the war with the Creek, it was Zel who helped Orson contact with
                                the Demon thanks to his origin. Orson, despite having doubts about Zel, kept
                                him as his advisor for the upcoming battle.

                                Kyla was a girly, little dragon born with a small body, she and Zel were best friends,
                                soulmates destined to be together. Before transforming into a hideous Cobra, Zel
                                grew up together with Kyla in an elder tree on the slope of the Jade Dragon Mountain.
                                They both loved exploring their new horizons with all the best in the world. When
                                Zel was banished from the Dragon world, only Kyla sympathized with him. Kyla believed
                                that nothing good ever came of violence, good things would come, and she could
                                bring her old friend back to The Greenland with his true form that God had given to him
                                - the immortal Dragon.

                                On these treacherous slopes of the Jade Dragon Mountain was where The Dragon lived.
                                Their dragon’s eggs here captured the essence of The Greenland and the purest Aether
                                energy for a very long time. Hundreds of years later, they would hatch, become the
                                immortal dragons roaming the skies with ultimate and infernal power. It could be said
                                that their power was in no way inferior to that of The Omni.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, among those eggs of The Dragon, there was the less fortunate one for not being
                                given enough vital energy. Kyla was a result of that, she was of a small
                                stature, if not very tiny when being compared to her race. But luckily, Kyla owned the
                                beautiful blue color with the flexibility and the agility. Kyla also had a unique
                                ability to transform the energy of the Sacred Grove, which is said to be the source of
                                The Greenland power. This ability allowed her to regenerate those already
                                destroyed such as Shadow of The Dead, but Kyla had yet to master it. Anyway, its
                                potential power was the reason why her skill was taken into consideration by Gideon, he
                                wanted to use it as the key for his mission of forging order out of chaos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Growing up with her was Zel, this little dragon always wanted to explore new lands and
                                good things of this universe. On the day Zel was expelled from The Dragon world
                                by his own kind, only Kyla sympathized with him. But being helpless, she had to see him
                                leave that way. Since then, Kyla always felt guilty for her weakness, for not
                                fighting to the bitter end for her friend.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the civil war of the Gods, Kyla knew that Zel was still alive and wandering
                                somewhere in misery on The Nightmare. She made a pact with Gideon that the Gods could
                                have her power for the next battle, in return, they had to help her take Zel back to
                                The Greenland to heal. Could Kyla’s wish be granted?

                                Farrer was an elite warrior of the Keen in Modern City. He was made by those
                                materialists who believed that magic was the root of all evils, only science was
                                essential
                                for their lives and for the universe. They established Modern City and created machines
                                in order to protect their city as well as to eliminate all magical sources in
                                the city. Through centuries of fighting, Farrer gradually realized that his inner power
                                was quite unique and stronger than he had ever thought; therefore, he secretly
                                planned to lead his race get out of the Human’s shadow and take control of their
                                destiny. He wanted to remove the Human from power and earn that title to rule Modern
                                City.

                                Since Aedus built the Sun Temple, this place attracted many mages and scholars coming to
                                learn about the power of Aether. Its library thus became the repository of all
                                the knowledge of Aether and things that happened on The Earth, including records of Lost
                                City - a city that flourished even before Crown Londo Kingdom was formed.
                                Rumor has it that this city was engulfed by a great flood. With its remains, some
                                scholars believed that Lost City was wiped out by the curse of an old magic that’s
                                beyond human understanding. However, Aedus himself did not, he thought that the Sun
                                Temple was a promise of a better future, not disease., if not disaster.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Robert Fischer was a senior member of the Sun Temple council at the time. However, he
                                was afraid of any possible misuse of magic. He always warned others in the Council
                                about the disaster scenario that came with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Opposed to Robert, his brother - Vincent Fischer was a passionate young man and had a
                                strong enthusiasm for magic. There were so many times when Robert warned Vincent
                                about the unimaginable consequences of magic, especially the old knowledge that Vincent
                                was day and night working on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then one day, while excavating the remains of Lost City, Vincent found a note about
                                an old magic that he had never seen in any books or records in the library
                                before. Being too excited by his discovery, he dived himself into the study of that
                                magic. But instead of a miracle, a Space Bridge appeared and opened up in front of
                                Vincent, the other side of the Bridge was just an endless black deep. It turned out to
                                be the legendary Hell Gate where The Darkness was residing. And just like that, a
                                part of The Darkness' power quickly followed the Bridge, penetrated into Vincent, and
                                seized control of his mind then. More tragically, Vincent's body was transformed
                                into a hideous monster.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many days after that, dozens of mysterious missing and gruesome murders took place in
                                the Sun Temple. Fears covered this whole place, forcing the Council and Aedus to
                                launch an investigation. Finally, that monster was killed, but its necklace was an
                                heirloom of the Fischer. Realizing this was his unfortunate brother, in grief and
                                resentment, Robert blamed Aedus for having ignored his warnings before. However, his
                                charges were eventually dropped by the Council. They put all the blame on Vincent
                                Fischer as he had secretly kept that deadly note and did it himself, causing serious
                                damage to the Temple.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being treated unfairly resonating with Vincent’s death, Robert staged a coup and got the
                                yes from some other members. They secretly stole records of Metal Art of Lost
                                City from the library. After that, Robert and his fellowmen went to the west of
                                Crown Londo Kingdom to establish Modern City - a city of Metal Art. All mages had to
                                give up their magic and would devote themselves to developing machines to serve life in
                                this new land. The new empire had begun, the Fisher Empire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to the records, in Lost City, Fischer called them Engineer and created many
                                advanced machines, including those known as robots. Engineers had examined and
                                finally found that Aether could be used as a special core generating endless energy.
                                Energy Heart was the name for this core because it brought life and an unlimited
                                power to the lifelessness, The Keen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In thousands of robots created, Farrer was the most advanced and finest one. Its purpose
                                was nothing more than to protect Modern City as well as to arrest those having
                                the audacity to practice magic in their land. His biggest weakness was Keen’s magnetic
                                environment, in this kind of environment, Farrer would be weakened as the Energy
                                Heart became very unstable and hard to control.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Gaining countless victories, increasing the body count along his way, Farrer gradually
                                became a symbol of Modern City spirit. But the more he lived, the more he
                                realized that the Human would die one day whereas The Keen would be immortal provided
                                Energy Heart and Aether still worked well. A big idea suddenly went through his
                                head that The Keen was born much superior to The Human. For that, Keen language - Code
                                of The Keen, was secretly developed by Farrer so they could easily communicate
                                with others without being detected by The Human. Since then, they sneakily made the plan
                                to overthrow the Fischer Empire in Modern City.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But that was just in the future, in the meantime, Modern City was having its hard time
                                when facing Crown Londo Kingdom of Silver Serpent. Silver had ambition for
                                dominating the entire lands on The Earth and Modern City was one of them. Although
                                Farrer and The Keen used to drive off Silver’s mighty army, that was just a temporary
                                success and from the golden age of Farrer.

                                Orson was once a Creek and a big believer in the Legendary Bengal pacifist ideology.
                                However, the death of his son completely changed him. Orson himself founded the
                                Sentinel - a new tribe to fight against the Creek. He accepted alienation and even
                                formed an alliance with the Demon just in order to avenge the death of his son.

                                Orson was one of Bengal's courtiers. He had great faith in the Legendary Bengal’s
                                ideology for peace of The Beast. And even when Bengal died because of old age, Orson
                                was the person who continued most of Bengal's legacy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, one time when his warriors passed through the Space Bridge to investigate the
                                statement of The Human side, unfortunately, an Auraminum arrow went straight
                                through the heart and killed his son, Kodiak. That Black Knight then was captured but
                                instead of executing him as Bengal had done before, Corbetti decided to make it
                                differently, he wanted to discuss with The Human and gave the most equitable punishment
                                for Black Knight in order to form an alliance with them. Orson thought this was
                                unfair to him, but Corbetti ignored it and believed this was the right direction for The
                                Beast.
                            </p>

                                Disagreeing with that action, Orson left The Creek and established the Sentinel to
                                declare war with Corbetti. Since then, Bengal's hard-working dream had been
                                shattered, and many Beasts left The Creek as they no longer trusted Corbetti.

                                Discontent and animosity - Orson now believed that The Beast had to return to its true
                                nature, The Big Fury. Opposing the ideal of The Creek, the Sentinel was always
                                eager to conquer and rule The Nightmare. For Orson, he could do anything to gain his
                                ends as well as bring down Corbetti to reclaim justice for his son. During the
                                battle for the Space Bridge, Corbetti was finished off by Orson. However, The Creek
                                still fought bravely and successfully defended the Space Bridge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Sentinel has suffered great losses since Tigris became the headman of the Creek. One
                                of Orson's decisions that changed the complexion of the war was to join forces
                                with The Demon. Orson and the Sentinel leaders allowed The Demons to use dark magic as well as the
                                Aether to strengthen the Sentinel warriors. The force of the immortal Sentinel also
                                formed from there. Not stopping at that, Sentinel could bring their army to transcend
                                the limitations of the Space Bridge to get to the Human world. The Beast and The
                                Demon - they constantly spread the terror across The Earth as the punishment for
                                the death of Orson’s son.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Orson now is no longer the warrior fighting for peace of The Beast but the ancient Beast
                                who comes back to its true nature, The Big Fury. Anyone who gets in his way
                                now, can only receive a brutal death.

                                Gideon was one of the strongest Omnis, known as the God of Power for his power of a
                                hurricane. In many places on the Earth, people worshiped and erected his statues as
                                a way to ward off evil spirits. Besides having great respect for Gideon, they were also
                                extremely afraid of his brutality. Gideon and his disciples were willing to
                                slaughter anyone they accused of being heretical mages; there were over 1000 innocent
                                people who died in their blood-letting purge. It was Gideon’s absolute justice
                                that unwittingly plunged the world toward annihilation.

                                From the dawn of time, when the Big Bang gave birth to the living source of energy -
                                Aether and all other creatures, The Omni and The Dragon were the first to set foot
                                on this universe. Next to the King of the Gods, Gideon was first of the firsts; he owned
                                an enormous power that could destroy anything that he defined as harmful to the
                                universe’s balance. That was the absolute justice Gideon always pursued.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For that justice, Gideon was always the leader in battles against the fallen Omni - who
                                intended to wipe out the Human on The Earth. He believed that those would lead
                                to a serious imbalance for his universe because all creatures on The Earth were also
                                born with Aether energy as those on The Greenland. By his unique power, Gideon
                                successfully repelled the attack targeting The Earth of those fallen Omnis, he nearly
                                destroyed all who tried to stand in his way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the civil war, the King decided to expel those fallen Omnis from The Greenland. This
                                fanned the flame of hatred in them. They came to The Nightmare, absorbed dark
                                power from The Darkness and slowly transformed themselves into a new race called The
                                Demon. Once The Demon returned, Gideon would be the first to get killed. However,
                                Gideon’s power and The Dragon were still the big wall preventing them from getting
                                revenge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With countless victories, The Human worshiped Gideon and even erected his statues to
                                ward off evil spirits. Many other people put their faith in his absolute justice
                                and became the Hunter hunting down the mages around The Earth and bringing them to
                                justice. Gideon gave them high-level skills that could manifest thunder and storm,
                                helping his disciples begin their crusade more easily. However, his perfect plans
                                backfired when thousands of people were accused of being mages for no reason and were
                                killed brutally in the name of Gideon. Gideon did this, he tapped into people’s rage
                                when creating these killers, these monsters. With no other choice, some chose to
                                side with The Demon to save themselves. Now that Gideon’s attempt of keeping the balance
                                accidentally pushed it to the brink of annihilation.

                                Aedus was one of the most powerful mages The Earth had ever seen. He soon became the
                                leader of the Mage and the custodian of the sacred Sun Temple, where Humans
                                could communicate with the Omnis. Then the war between the light and the dark broke out
                                as the things Aedus predicted came true, but he could never have imagined that
                                it was the people he trusted the most who were the cause of this whole nightmare.

                                Since the dawn of time, when all over The Earth were ancient tribes getting into
                                constant wars over territory and food. This era of turmoil persisted until the
                                presence of the twins - Aedus and Malhela. Their parents died on the battlefield, and
                                they were caught by the Alken - cannibals. They wanted to use these two children
                                to make a lavish meal for the alive warriors. Just as Aedus was about to be drawn and
                                quartered, the Aether energy inside Aedus broke the seal, exploded and killed
                                everyone but Malhela. Immediately, at the same time, The Elves sensed that unusual magic
                                and sent their people searching for the source. They all knew that Aedus was
                                born to the call of Aether, he was able to feel and control its power. Aedus is likely
                                to be a mage of godlike power. Letting that power corrupt or fall into the wrong
                                hands would be a great threat to The Earth. In the end, The Elves adopted both
                                children to curb their wanton display of power, taught them the intricacies and how to
                                control their power.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Exactly what The Elves had expected, Aedus had grown up and became the most powerful
                                mage in the history of The Earth at that time. Having lived with The Elves since
                                childhood, the two children were raised to be good, especially their strong belief in
                                the Omni gods. With that faith, Aedus had his dream to march under the banner of
                                justice and valor, establish order for the peace in the name of Omni
                                gods. He left The Elves and the Sun Temple was then founded and expanded on Aedus’
                                belief for justice. This Temple was a place, a means for the normal Human to possess the
                                power and maintain their lives. Among those Humans, there was a uniquely
                                talented individual - the Silver Serpent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Aedus was Silver's greatest teacher and inspiration during his young days. He in turn
                                considered Silver to be the student he trusted most and let him capture all the
                                quintessence of magic. With Silver’s bravery and talent, Aedus believed that Silver
                                would be the one to pass on the torch from his generation and unite all tribes on
                                The Earth, ushering in an era of peace and prosperity. However, Aedus didn’t imagine
                                that his faith would be lost and the whole universe soon drowned in blood and
                                tears. When Silver fell, he did not fall alone, that’s the way of the world. The most
                                terrifying episode in history is about to be uncovered.

                                    Octonus was a Beast of the Eurypterid residing in the barren Destiny Desert. Every
                                    Eurypterid was a unique and separate individual because they each had their own
                                    territory and defended it against any intruder.

                                    Even though the fury of The Creek had been over thousands of years ago and it was
                                    still reducing, the Eurypterid stayed the original nature of The Beast. Of all the
                                    Eurypterids, Octonus is the most dominant, not only cruel but also dangerous and
                                    opportunistic. Unlike his kind, Octonus interacted with the power of The Darkness
                                    in a very different way. It was as if The Darkness had activated him to gain reason
                                    and think quite independently, out of the intellectual restraints of an animal
                                    race. Over time, he gradually took control of The Darkness' energy and became one of
                                    the most feared monsters The Nightmare ever had.

                                    Octonus was an Eurypterid of the Destiny Desert. Legend has it that inside Hell Gate

                                    and appeared on this Destiny Desert. The waste, the barrenness of this desert with
                                    its heat made the strongest Beasts in The Darkest Jungle dare not set foot, and
                                    even since then, this place was isolated from the rest of The Nightmare. There
                                    existed only one race - the Eurypterid. Thanks to the direct power of The Darkness,

                                    they got hungry or any living thing invaded their territory, they would destroy it
                                    all. They were favored with the agility and the ability to wait for the right times.
                                    Moreover, Eurypterids' crust on the outside gave them an extraordinary
                                    endurance in the heat of the Desert.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Octonus, like many other Eurypterids, was very ferocious and agile, however, the
                                    dark power he possessed was distinct from the rest. That energy quickly took
                                    control of him, bestowing him a gift called “wisdom”. For that evolution, the entire
                                    race of Eurypterids bowed to his power, Octonus called himself the Scorpion
                                    King. Since then, there was a great storm welling up inside him - bringing The
                                    Darkness power back to rule the universe.

                                Grimm, like Cyril and Ciara, was a demon lord of The Nightmare. Grimm, on the other hand, was more cruel than brutal. He did not slaughter his prey as other Demons.
                                Instead, he would torture them until hearing them scream in agony and watching them flutter, all he wanted was to see others suffering the pain. He crazily loved the
                                pain, for him the pain was like a beautiful symphony and he was the artist finding the rhythms of his life. For that reason, he left The Greenland and reached The
                                Nightmare - a world filled with sorrow, where he could easily enjoy the pain he desired. Living a peaceful life on The Greenland was not for a cold-blooded artist like
                                him.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Despite being an Omni god, Grimm was extremely attracted to the death and pain of others. He always took the name of The Omni, seeking the battlefield where Human
                                tribes were competing in order to secretly provoke wars. At the outbreak of war between The Omni and The Demon, Grimm was more excited than ever. He'd seen a lot of
                                horrible things on the Earth among Humans, but this was the first time he'd been treated with a scene of among Gods.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the war, he left the boring Greenland and got to The Nightmare - a world filled
                                with death and sorrow, where he could easily enjoy the pain he desired. Grimm knew
                                that the aim of The Demon was to destroy all to stand master of the universe. But if
                                this war ended, there would be no pain left, what would he live for when it’s all
                                over? Obviously, Grimm did not want this at all so he did all things to prevent both
                                sides from gaining the ground in the battle.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By bluff and guile, Grimm easily became the custodian of the Hell Gate. By knowing how
                                to harness the power of The Darkness, his power suddenly rocketed compared to
                                that when he was on The Greenland. With that power in hand, he defeated countless fierce
                                enemies and threatened anyone who stood in his way. Moreover, he took his seat and
                                stood astride both worlds, The Omni and The Demon. The Omnis wanted to eliminate The
                                Darkness while The Demons ruled it to unlock and boost the dark power within them.
                                That was a perfect balance to Grimm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Grimm soon realized that there would be no more drama unless someone pulled the
                                strings. After that, Grimm started his own plan to let the anguish, the pain and the
                                wish for death take over this universe. So he found ways to contact Malhela - a great
                                mage serving under Silver. He came there and revealed to Malhela all those secrets
                                of life and how The Omni deceived The Human. Grimm wanted The Human to worship The Demon
                                and use dark power from The Darkness instead of Aether. And last, he revealed
                                the secret of opening a Space Bridge where all definitions were distorted. A Space
                                Bridge would be a tunnel for The Beast to get in and help Silver unite the world, but
                                in return, Mahela had to help Grimm with one thing. Till now, no one knew exactly what
                                really happened between them two, but the doomsday Dark Moon was coming. The
                                whole universe was sunk into the abyss of a new dark age, being in pain and being in
                                fear. That was exactly what Grimm always pursued. But was it true that this was his
                                dream or was it just a drama made by an artist playing his deadly symphonies?

                                Amaltheus was a Beast of the Creek, not only a pacifist but also a militant pacifist. A
                                cool head and a lucid mind are characters that helped him to become Tigris’
                                right-hand man despite his young age. He possessed the twin blade which he found in
                                Inferno. Legend has it that this weapon was made for Amaltheus as it helped unlock
                                the power within him. However, this was also the time when he faced the corruption of
                                the Darkness from the inside. Dreams and obsessions about the Darkness made
                                Amaltheus lose control at times, but deep down there was a good person. His battle now
                                is not simply to protect the Creeks, but also the two sides at war within him,
                                with The Darkness. If he loses this war, he will become a slave to the Darkness.

                                Amaltheus was the son of a Creek priest. His ancestors were hell mountain goats with
                                solid horns on their heads. Therefore, Amaltheus had to study and learn about a
                                kind of magic called Yin-Yang Horn at an early age with dark energy from The Darkness.
                                Undergoing a lengthy process of training, Amaltheus was the youngest Beast to
                                awaken this power and master Yin-Yang Horn. Besides his magic power, Amaltheus was very
                                calm and wise in all of his decisions, as well as a very agile and resourceful
                                warrior on the battlefield.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Amaltheus was Tigris’s childhood friend. As he grew up and was the second in command
                                when Tigris became the headman of Creek tribe. In a war at the Deadly Swamp, it was
                                Amaltheus who planned to lead Orson's army into here, putting them up to very heavy
                                casualties and all of that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once, when scouting to the Inferno, Amaltheus accidentally found a twin blade rumored to
                                be the bones of the legendary Chimera hell dragon, which had spent thousands of
                                years forging in the Inferno. This twin blade itself also carried a dark energy of The
                                Darkness. By his mastery of the Yin-Yang Horn, Amaltheus was able to control this
                                dark energy. But it always wanted to invade him to rise up, and there was a time when
                                the twin blade succeeded, but he still won to reclaim his reason. He named this
                                twin blade "Bugs", no matter how hard he tried to get rid of Bugs, it always returned to
                                the hand of its master.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, when The Demons have joined Orson to push the war in The Nightmare to the furthest
                                edge, Amaltheus and his twin blade are ready to pose any challenge. It is not
                                enough to simply wish for peace, one must have the ability to defend peace. And for
                                Amaltheus, there is not only a war for justice out there, but also a struggle with
                                the Darkness inside him.

                                against The Human on The Earth and the gods in The Greenland for rejecting his faith. He attempted to consolidate the Demons' influence on The Earth by transforming
                                Humans into Ogres. Brutal and possessing the ability to reincarnate upon death, he became the worst nightmare on The Earth. He raised a monstrous Ogre legion in the
                                Black Fortress and posed a threat to the survival of all living things on The Earth.

                                There was a stronghold called Leap Castle in the south of The Earth, a mage named Thaddeus led the charge here. Thaddeus was a wise and fair human and he loved his
                                people. He also worshiped and believed in the Omni gods in The Greenland.
                            </p>

                                Thaddeus always avoided the battles and resolved things peaceably to prevent his stronghold from being thrown into chaos. To defend the people here, he made an alliance
                                with Crown Londo Kingdom. They had each other’s backs, Crown Londo Kingdom would take Thaddeus’ knowledge about magic, in return, Leap Castle would be under their
                                protection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One time while Crown Londo Kingdom went all its strength out to fight against Modern City (a Keen’s city that hated magic), the enemies from the south of Crown Londo
                                Kingdom delivered their troops to conquer Leap Castle.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thaddeus had used up all his magic to hold out for its alliance. After several days, Leap Castle's warriors gradually exhausted and dwindled. Thaddeus's pleas for help
                                from the Crown Londo Kingdom were ignored, and even his request to the Omni went unanswered. In the end, Leap Castle fell. He had no choice but begging for mercy from
                                his enemies, but all in vain. They took out his whole family right in front of him. What hurt the most was that they tied him with their corpses at the gate to threaten
                                the people of Leap Castle.
                            </p>

                                In the depths of despair, one with a creepy voice, Cyril, appeared and told that he could help him turn the tables, take Leap Castle back, and destroy every man to
                                blame for his family's death. For that, Thaddeus had to commend his soul to Cyril and take the power from The Darkness. Accepting that offer, Thaddeus became the first
                                Ogre of The Earth. He wiped out his enemies in a very bloodthirsty way by using his new powers and magic. Obsessed with that unimaginable power, he transformed all of
                                Leap Castle’s people into Ogre like him. The Ogre emerged from this episode in history. Thaddeus proclaimed himself Kekor - Warlord of the Ogre and Leap Castle the
                                Black Fortress - the lair of the Ogre on The Earth.

                                Now that Kekor and his army have become the new threat to The Earth. Kekor's ultimate goal is to expand the influence of The Ogre, wiping out all Human lives by
                                seducing and turning them into Ogres. They strikes terror into The Earth as the darkest omen of the impending invasion from The Demon…

                                The Nightmare was once inhabited by the Creek - an indigenous tribe that were mostly
                                concentrated in the Darkest Jungle. Tigris had been a headman of that tribe since
                                he was very young, but his strength and intelligence were second to none. From an early
                                age, Tigris was taught by his grandfather and father about the Nightmare with
                                peace and unity. However, that’s all impossible when those lost Omnis came here with new
                                powers, exploited the dark power of the Darkness, slowly turned bad and named
                                themselves the Demons - a new race and a byword for cruelty. They used their psychic
                                powers to manipulate and make the Beast - which were born from darkness extremely
                                insane and bloodthirsty. Now the only way out is that Tigris has to find ways to unite
                                with The Human on The Earth to repel the evil forces or his tribe will perish
                                from this land.

                                After the Big Bang, The Darkness hid itself from Aether's aura in The Nightmare - where
                                light cannot reach. That explosion at the same time awakened The Beast, they
                                came from the depths of The Nightmare and absorbed the evil of The Darkness. With such
                                powers, they sowed the seeds of fear across The Earth through Space Bridges
                                scattered throughout. But after thousands of years of this darkness invasion, a new
                                tribe - Creek, concentrated in the Darkest Jungle, appeared with the desire to go
                                against the beliefs of The Nightmare - “peace”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tigris was the son of the headman Corbetti and grandson of the Legendary Bengal. He has
                                been living in love and trained by his father and grandfather since he was just
                                a child. With the duty of being the next headman of the Creek, Tigris worked very hard
                                to become the strongest even though he didn't want it. Indeed, his dream was to
                                have a normal life like other Creek friends.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Melina and Amaltheus were Tigris’ friends. Melina was a Demi-Beast (half-human
                                half-beast) with a Human mother and a Beast father. She is often shunned because of her
                                origin, but Tigris was different, he always showed his respect for her, especially her
                                integrity. As for Amaltheus, Tigris' best friend growing up, they trained
                                together. When they were young, they often sneaked to an abandoned Space Bridge to get to the
                                other side of The Wall and watched the sunrise, for Tigris, that was one of the best
                                memories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then a bloody battle started, confronting the army of fallen souls and demons, his
                                father Corbetti was defeated by Orson on the battlefield. He soon had to carry
                                his responsibilities as the headman of the Creeks in his father’s place and became the
                                youngest one in thousands of years of history.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With his tenacious courage in battle and the help of Melina and Amaltheus in leading The
                                Creek, all the doubts going against his leadership were soon avoided. Along
                                with his true friends, Creeks returned to its golden age - the era that his grandfather,
                                the Legendary Bengal, had done before.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Demons that looked for The Darkness’ powers have joined the war in The Nightmare.
                                They had dealings with Orson to combine the power of the Darkness with Aether,
                                making the Beast agitated and completely driven by the blood.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Facing the prospect of being defeated by Orson and Demons, Tigris put his trust in the
                                Human on the other side of the Space Bridges.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One time while scouting the Space Bridge, Tigris happened to save one strange man who
                                was being hunted by Black Knights. Melina, with her talent, nursed him back to
                                health and he revealed he was Brian Kide - once the commander of Black Knights and
                                hunted by his own people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now that with the union of the most revered headman of The Earth and The Nightmare,
                                could an alliance between the Human and the Beast be formed? They both wanted to
                                eradicate evil and protect peace for their homeland by crushing the ambitions of Orson
                                in the Nightmare and Silver Serpent on The Earth.

                                Malhela is Aedus’s twin. The two brothers were rescued by the Elf after Aedus exploded
                                his magical power. With natural gift, Aedus quickly mastered the complex skills
                                taught by the
                                Elf whereas it was not that luck for Malhela, he would never stand where his twin’s
                                standing. Malhela could hardly be a greater mage as he could do no more than he
                                could, the magic
                                that he learned and possessed was extremely limited. But Malhela somehow was not
                                discouraged, he worked very hard and became Aedus' right-hand man in his pursuit of
                                justice and for
                                the Sun Temple.

                            <p>
                                After the event changed the fortunes of the twin, together with Aedus, Malhela
                                established The Sun Temple. He here met Silver Serpent, a young teenager, who wished to
                                unite The Earth and create a prosperous and peaceful world. Malhela, unlike his
                                brother, was more like Silver’s partner since he found in Silver his reflection, for
                                having the same starting points and the desire to be a peacebuilder. He was a victim of
                                tribal wars so he didn’t want any child to suffer those painful things like him.
                                For that, Malhela became Silver’s mastermind in the Silver Dragon forces. With
                                incredible ingenuity, bravery from Silver and wisdom and strategy from Malhela, the
                                Silver Dragon forces gained countless victories and greatly impeded all the invasion
                                plans. This turned The Human, once looked down on by other races, were finally
                                earning people’s trust and recognition, conquering The Earth except for the Shadow
                                Fortress of the Alken.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And shortly after, bowing to the overwhelming power of the Alken in their ambush, the
                                Silver Dragon forces had to admit defeat. More than ⅔ of the forces perished and
                                became food for those bloodlust cannibals. Witnessing that bloody scene, Malhela’s hate
                                rose, fast and volcanic. Even Silver also couldn’t handle his anger that their
                                hope and dream for justice had collapsed. Silver and Malhela got to the Sun Temple
                                asking for help from other great mages in order to turn the tide of war. But all
                                Malhela had was a “no” for an answer from Aedus. Aedus believed that the magic bestowed
                                from The Omnis was just for developing life, not for war. This enraged Malhela
                                as he considered Aedus as a weak man because Aedus always yearned for peace and
                                prosperity but had never fought for it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But those obstacles could not make Malhela give up. Together with Silver, they
                                determined to investigate the power of the Alken. Despite being limited by their magical
                                abilities, they detected some mysterious energy generated when those Alken ate people
                                and then found out cannibalism was one of the ways to indirectly absorb Aether’s
                                power. The Alken were as powerful as the demon because they had unwittingly absorbed too
                                much Aether. And just like that, Malhela and Silver dived into how to capture
                                souls from the living and turn them into their power.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These plans immediately reached Aedus’ ears but it was too late. Both Silver and Malhela
                                were then expelled from the Sun Temple but this didn’t make sense to them
                                anymore. By the devastating power they had captured, the Silver Dragon suddenly became
                                more powerful than ever. Malhela is now as strong as his brother and can even
                                open his own Space Bridge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Taking advantage of that tremendous power, Aedus and Silver quickly avenged their loss
                                and annihilated all the Alken. Since then, most of The Earth has been unified
                                under the Silver Serpent. A new dynasty has begun, marking the beginning of a
                                never-ending tragedy.

                                Iona was one of the youngest mages at the Elpida Temple. When the evil king Silver sent his army to Elpida Temple to seize the scepter - Godwyn’s treasure, Iona
                                unlocked a new power generating a meteor shower inflicting the enemy's repulse.

                                Elpida Temple was finally safe. And for that, the reputation of the scepter was spread throughout The Earth. Iona was now officially the guardian of this sacred temple.

                                After the establishment of The Sun Temple, there were many other temples built throughout The Earth in order to worship the gods. One of them, Elpida Temple, lay
                                between The Sun Temple and the path leading to Dreaming Valley, was used to praise Godwyn. The nuns here majored in healing spells and herbs. But, despite its idyllic
                                look, there might present challenges for anyone so Elpida Temple owned an army of its own - Mages with great light power, to protect the temple and nuns from those with
                                sleepless malice and worldly desires. The Scepter of Godwyn was the name given to those mages. Among them, Iona was one of the youngest that Elpida Temple had ever
                                trained. Smart, creative and virtuous were all that could be used to describe her. With that talent, Iona quickly acquired the power of Aether from her masters at
                                Elpida Temple.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Iona wielded a scepter known as one of the treasures of Godwyn. It originally belonged to The High Septon of Elpida Temple. However, its superior power soon put it on
                                Silver’s radar. With this unique treasure, Silver aspired to equip the Aether for his forces. He then immediately sent his army to Elpida Temple to seize it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In her final moments, Iona grasped the scepter and unlocked a new power deep inside her. That kind of power resonated with the scepter, together they generated a meteor
                                shower inflicting the enemy's repulse. Unfortunately, pain was pain. Even Silver’s forces were defeated and Elpida Temple was saved, the Temple had been seriously
                                damaged as well as the reputation of the scepter was spread throughout The Earth. Since then, Elpida Temple had become the target of those who coveted the scepter,
                                including Silver. He vowed to return and do anything to have that power, and also Iona.

                                Akoser, who used to be Hewglington, was one of the most skillful blacksmiths in the Iron Fortress. He used to have a happy and perfect family life. But then a tragedy
                                happened to him. A curse caused him to rise up a lot of stone scales on his skin and completely changed his appearance. In despair and desire to survive, Hewglinton,
                                with his last energy, came to Elpida Temple and asked them for a favor.

                                Unfortunately, his fate fell into the wrong hands, Kekor. This cunning Ogre secretly used the power of The Darkness to enslave and make Hewglington do the dirty work
                                for him. Kekor then gave this poor blacksmith a new name - Akoser.

                                Hewglington was one of the most skillful blacksmiths in Iron Fortress, he used to have a happy and perfect family life. But then, a horrible tragedy happened to him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once on a journey to the Forgotten Mines with an aim of finding more materials, Hewglinton discovered a secret room. The second he got into the room, he was exposed to
                                poison gas without even knowing that. That gas slowly transformed Hewglinton. His skin suddenly rose up a lot of stone scales and over time they seemed to completely
                                change the outside of Hewglinton. As a curse, he was deteriorating every day, physically and mentally. Hewglinton had grown into a savage beast with almost no
                                recognizable humanity left in him, he could go crazy at any time and attack anyone around him.
                            </p>

                                In despair and desire to survive, Hewglinton, with his last energy, came to Elpida Temple and asked them for a favor. But this journey was not easy at all, especially
                                for him. He sailed across the Crown Londo Kingdom with a wish to be free from this curse. However, fate had brought him to a darker place when his boat was destroyed by
                                a storm. Luckily, Hewglinton was still alive after that tragedy and washed up on the beach. Unfortunately, the first person who found him was not the nuns of Elpida
                                Temple but Kekor - the cunning Ogre of the Black Fortress. And with his dying breath, Hewglinton had to beg Kekor for help. Realizing the strangeness of the poor
                                blacksmith’s skin, Kekor used his power to ease his pain. Besides the power from The Darkness, Kekor also imbued Hewglinton’s body with ancient magic to enhance those
                                scales into extremely strong crystals.
                            </p>

                                With the corruption of The Darkness, the poor blacksmith now seemed to lose all his memories of the past. Kekor granted him a new name - Akoser and saved him for the
                                larger battle to come. Although losing all his memories, Akoser always had a silhouette buried deep inside him, of something that he shouldn’t have forgotten. Was it
                                something precious, or was it someone waiting for him?

                                Lagan was the commander of the Flame Draconian. He proved himself a force to be feared and obeyed by everyone, including Adonis, the Dragon Lord. During the war of the
                                Gods, he had made no small contribution to fighting against Leviathan and the rebels. But his infernal power was to blame for the death of Hanleth the Goddess when she
                                sacrificed herself to save the Sky Meadow. It was thanks to this tragedy that made Lagan himself realize that he needed to be more careful with his power, and this
                                thought later became Lagan's fatal flaw.

                                Before Lagan took over as leader, the place of the Flame Draconian tribe was not appreciated in the Jade Dragon Mountain. But, with his strength and courage, Lagan
                                gradually restored the Flame Draconian place and proved himself a force to be feared and obeyed by everyone, including Adonis, the Dragon Lord. In the fight on the
                                Deshading top, Lagan could have almost defeated Adonis if it hadn't been for Topazos and Anemos getting in the way. Failure, but a notable failure, and once again,
                                Lagan proved himself invaluable to come very close to the crown of the Deshading top. Lagan's goal was to bring the Flame Draconian back to its rightful place - the top
                                of the mountain, which concentrated most of the elite Aether in the Jade Dragon Mountain and above all, their ancestral homeland but after decades of struggle, they got
                                defeated and had to leave it to the Everlasting Draconian of Adonis.

                                Despite having a long-standing rivalry, Lagan together with Adonis joined in the battle of the Omnis against Leviathan and the rebels. Lagan's infernal power was to
                                blame for all the ruins in Sky Meadow and even for the sacrifice of Hanleth the Goddess. It was thanks to this tragedy that made Lagan himself realize that he needed to

                                Eryk was known as the most loyal guard under Silver. As for Eryk’s support, Silver could easily suppress any opponents, any dominating forces on The Earth who dared to

                                Eryk was originally a member of the Serpent. However, when they realized Eryk was born as the product of a forbidden affair between a Serpent prince and a Snjor
                                princess, he was immediately shunned by his own family. Thanks to his Snjor ancestors' blood, Eryk possessed the ability to control ice and snow.

                                to assist him on a crucial expedition to the Rock Castle. The goal was to conquer the Astor family. After this event, Eryk proved himself as a formidable warrior of the
                                Serpent family and gained respect from everyone in Crown Londo Kingdom. Eryk completely trusted in Silver ideals, even if they went against those of the supreme gods

                                deserving heir of Gideon because he possessed all of his father's strongest features: tremendous physical strength combined with a natural talent for magic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's a great responsibility to name an Heir as well as a lot of pressure from Gideon when Abaddon was just a child. Gideon sent Abaddon into the toughest training and
                                put all kinds of philosophies and ideas of a thing called “absolute justice” in his head. Moreover, Gideon had a clear idea of the path that he wanted his son to be on,
                                and he did everything to make sure it was right. As a result, there was a growing rift between them and things just got worse, worse and worse. However, Abaddon had no
                                choice but to obey his father because he still loved and respected him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Abaddon had a romantic relationship with Tiany, Leviathan’s daughter. The reason why Leviathan engulfed the Lost City was that its people dared to offend Princess Tiany
                                as they summoned the goddess and tried to take control of her mind. When Leviathan was exiled, Tiany tried everything to free her father and was arrested shortly after
                                that. With his arguments, Gideon considered Tiany a rebel and put her under arrest in her own home. Moreover, he forbade his son, Abaddon, to see her. And then, in one
                                night, an unthinkable happened, Tiany took her own life and left the last message for Abaddon: “Do not become your father, and do not let this be your fate”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the death of his love, Abaddon completely changed, he realized that he had lost all his respect for Gideon. As soon as Cyril started wars in The Greenland to
                                rescue Leviathan, Abaddon immediately became the leader of this legion. Owing to his might and understanding of the Horror of An Eye, things went very smoothly. Fleeing
                                to The Nightmare with two other evil gods, Abaddon later agreed to absorb The Darkness and became Leviathan's right-hand man. Now, Abaddon had only one thing in his
                                mind, which was to destroy Gideon and avenge Tiany.

                                Godwyn was one of the supreme gods that had an enormous influence on The Earth. There were temples built under her protection, especially the Elpida Temple, where she
                                had bestowed the privilege of owning the powerful scepter. Godwyn also taught the mages and nuns her knowledge about the art of healing and protection. Moreover, Godwyn
                                had a close connection with the Dreaming Valley. It was Godwyn who granted Alva the power to protect Idril and the Dreaming Valley when the tragedy happened in Idril
                                Castle. Despite being the goddess of mercy, there was inconsolable grief inside her when her brother Abaddon left The Greenland and became one of the most notorious
                                Demons under the evil king Leviathan.

                                Godwyn was the one who examined Zel's records and successfully purged the upstream of the Magic Lake, bringing the Waterlife to life. Godwyn was also one of the first
                                gods when Kyla Academy was in its infancy and was well-known for her art of healing and protection. Unlike Gideon, her father, who was a warrior with his strict
                                discipline, Godwyn was a more reasonable one. She was the only thing that could hold her father and her brother, Abaddon, together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Godwyn appeared on The Earth much later than other Omni gods, but she soon wielded enormous influence over this land. Specifically, there were temples built under her
                                protection, especially the Elpida Temple, where she had bestowed the privilege of owning the powerful scepter. Godwyn also taught the mages and nuns her knowledge about
                                the art of healing and protection. The scepter functioned as a protection charm for the temple and was kept by The High Septon. They gave it all kinds of protections
                                and were responsible for handing it down to the next generation. Godwyn also granted Alva the power to protect the Idril and the Dreaming Valley from Kekor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Godwyn, contrary to her father, had faith that compassion and forgiveness could charm any evil things. Like Kyla, Godwyn believed that there was goodness in every
                                creature, either good or evil. It was a matter of actually seeing and keeping the good in them. She was extremely depressed after the gods' war when her brother Abaddon
                                left The Greenland, going up against their father, Gideon. But soon she did understand that it was Gideon’s oppressive rulership why her brother was so insane. After
                                the great war, Godwyn, together with Kyla and the goddess Prostasia, attempted to reconstruct part of the forest of Greenland. But what about Abaddon? Would Godwyn
                                reunite with her brother and heal their fractured bond? And would Godwyn return to The Earth to fight side by side with the Humans in the battle against the evil
                                Demons' expansion?

                                Caim was once the brightest mind of Kyla Academy. Despite being an Omni, Caim had a strong passion for ancient forbidden arts. Brilliant as he was, he was kind of a
                                weirdo and this alienated him from other students. Besides those holy arts taught at the Academy, Caim had been secretly studying Blood Magic, one of the most powerful
                                ancient arts that ever known. And gradually, over time, its darkness slowly gained control over him. After being uncovered the truth, Caim along with Grimm then moved
                                to The Nightmare. Here, Caim used the dark power from The Darkness to continue the unfinished things that he could not complete in The Greenland…

                                When the war of the gods reached its climax, there was blood and bodies everywhere, his obsession with death drove him mad and planted in him a crazy idea. With his
                                judgment and deep knowledge of Blood Magic, he threw himself into work searching for immortality. To achieve his ends, Caim concocted plans to kidnap students at the
                                Academy for experiments. But the truth would always come out. When the war drew to its end, Caim's secret was finally foiled by a victim who escaped from his sick

                                Caim then fled The Greenland and followed Grimm to continue his experiments. By dealing with the evil for power from The Darkness, the corrupted god combined with his
                                natural talent, struck terror on both The Earth and The Nightmare. The number of victims increased exponentially and there was blood going everywhere. Caim became more
                                and more obsessed and refused to let anything stand in his way. Could Caim achieve his evil machinations?
